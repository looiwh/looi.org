A newer version of looi.in

# How it works
Created with a mix of bootstrap and webstorm. This website is designed to be as efficient as possible as it doesn't serve any image at all. Most of the stuff is being run on css and bootstrap 4

# Server encryptions
Basic SSL and ssh keys will be applied such that attackers should have a harder time penetrating the systems
